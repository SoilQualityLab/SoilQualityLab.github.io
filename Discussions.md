# We DISCUSS papers, papers with code, books and lists of published work

Listification is our process for developing HYBRID intelligence. Listifying is fundamentally recursive. We develop executable lists ... lists with annotations which are presented [stylistically](https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/css/knowledge-graph) in a human readable [knowledge graph analtyic](https://learning.oreilly.com/topics/graph-analytics/) format ... thoses lists have immediate informative value, but the lists with notations also could be used an API input for generating the next list.

Adding intelligence through curation by collecting, annotating and/or indexing human-readable lists  of machine intelligence tools ... but the user-interface is about the general nature of human intelligence and cognition ... sure, we want to lists to computer-executable, but we also want to lists to be human-readable and human-annotatable.

We are especially interested in lists of pre-print archives and repositories of code, data, papers with code and machine learning models ... these machine learning models will typicably be [from Python libraries]() excuted in Jupyter notebook or something that behaves similarly in an environment like [CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/signup/pricing?utm_source=dialog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=settings_page) or perhaps in a more configurable environment such as [Google CloudVertexAI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing)].

A# Socially Annotations of Lists / RSS Feeds / Connected Papers

Reading something does not really give on much insight. The insight comes later after mulling over what was read, sharing an opinion on the reading and, ***ideally, getting into an argument and defending one's opinion.***

Thus our ANNOTIFY.app will necessarily be a social media appliance or plug-in ... without the ability to at least share an annotation, we are stuck with only re-reading our own annotations ... which is no small thing, but the important part comes from writing something that one knows others might argue over.

***EVEN when it's private*** your annotations are written to be read by a later version of you, the version of you who is hopefully smarter and more cultivated, the version of you that has cooled off emotionally, the version of you that sees the world differently than the you of right now. The point here is that annotations are necessarily social ... even when they are private or restricted to small audience of very similar people.

# Listing of Listified Lists

## Workout Lists

Our process of revising and edit Workout Lists is that we really must do these workouts.

* Gardening, Landsculpting, Cooking

* Tabatas, Martial Arts, Yoga, Weight Lifting

* Hikes, Housework, Walking, Biking

## Art Lists

* Landsculpting

* Photography

* Museums and Galleries

## Reading Lists

* Classics

* Newsreaders

* Pre-Print Archives

* Threads / Comment Poetry

## Venture Lists

We also think in terms of other lists for Ventures

* Quantum Cloud Kernel Reading List

* Computational Biology Reading List

* Asynchronous Workflow Reading List

* Computational Linguistics Reading List
