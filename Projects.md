Carbon sequestration is about soil quality ... our projects are about DEFINING, MEASURING, ANALYZING, IMPROVING and SUSTAINING the knowledge of the living ecosystems of soil.

## DEFINING

Our view is that living soil ecosystems are fundamentally about processing information in an optimal fashion, eg *optimal* in a healthy sense of what the term might means probably means something like maximizing Life. Thus, since the purpose of the ecosystem is optimize information processing, nueorological science is the best starting approximation ... or model for theoretically exploring DEFINING the nature of living soil ecosystems.

The skin of our planet functions as a living macronetwork of nuerological cells and brains that in communication with other brains. We live on a planet that is a living organism ... and although we are tiny part of that organism, we imagine that we should be in control of it. The human species is much like a virus ... except that viruses will have greater longevity. It is up to humans to either understand the nature of the living organism that is our planet ... or to be driven to extinction for failing to even bother to understand that ecosystem. *DEFINING what soil is about is kind of an important project.*
