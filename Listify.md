# Listification is HYBRID intelligence

Listifying is about adding intelligence through curation by collecting, annotating and/or indexing human-readable lists  of machine intelligence tools.

We are especially interested in lists of pre-print archives and repositories of code, data, papers with code and machine learning models ... these machine learning models will typicably be [from Python libraries]() excuted in Jupyter notebook or something that behaves similarly in an environment like [CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/signup/pricing?utm_source=dialog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=settings_page) or perhaps in a more configurable environment such as [Google CloudVertexAI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing)].

Annotated lists help form the basis of algorithms behind semiotic and semantic graphs ... it's really a matter of growing or extending noospheres with organic, "almost mycorrhizal" living conceptual pathways ... starting with very simple human-readable lists ... which becomes checkist or perhaps a priorizable outline driving an open issue deck ... along the way, we add annoations and make new connections ... continuously editing and revising ... to eventually think in visual graphs and then do that with intelligence infrastructure in code, such as ConnectedPapers ... with hopefully standard data API format such as maybe a simplistic CSV, slightly more valuable JSON or a graphQL data API ... so that others can re-use the connections.


# Listing of Listified Lists

## Workout Lists

Our process of revising and edit Workout Lists is that we really must do these workouts.

* Photography

* Museums and Galleries

## Reading Lists

* Classics

* Newsreaders

* Pre-Print Archives

* Threads / Comment Poetry

## Venture Lists

We also think in terms of other lists for Ventures

* Quantum Cloud Kernel Reading List
