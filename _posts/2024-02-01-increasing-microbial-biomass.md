**Sequester C as life**

Understand the reason for why Life is based upon the carbon cycle RATHER than just *pounding on about sand* involves [in part] intuitively understand how neurons have evolved over millions of years and now develop morphologically [and sustainably].

## Increasing fungal biomass in soil

Increasing microbial biomass in soil is essential for improving soil health, fertility, and structure. Many of the practices used to increase fungal biomass also support the growth of other beneficial soil microorganisms. Here are some specific practices that can help greatly increase the microbial biomass in soil:

1. Add organic matter: Incorporate a variety of organic materials, such as compost, aged manure, green manure, and crop residues, into the soil. Organic matter serves as a food source for microbes, promoting their growth and diversity.

2. Use cover crops: Plant a diverse mix of cover crops, including legumes, grasses, and brassicas. Cover crops add organic matter, improve soil structure, and provide a living host for beneficial microbes.

3. Minimize tillage: Reduce tillage practices to avoid disrupting soil structure and microbial communities. No-till or minimal tillage techniques help preserve the delicate microhabitats where microbes thrive.

4. Maintain soil moisture: Keep soil moisture levels consistent and within the optimal range for microbial growth. Use mulch, drip irrigation, or other water conservation techniques to prevent moisture fluctuations.

5. Avoid synthetic chemicals: Reduce the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides, as these can harm beneficial soil microbes. Instead, opt for organic fertilizers and integrated pest management strategies.

6. Implement crop rotation: Practice diverse crop rotation to prevent the buildup of soil-borne pathogens and promote a variety of microbial communities. Include legumes in the rotation to fix atmospheric nitrogen and support microbial growth.

7. Incorporate agroforestry: Integrate trees and shrubs into agricultural systems through practices like alley cropping, silvopasture, and windbreaks. Trees and shrubs contribute to soil organic matter and provide a diverse habitat for microbes.

8. Use biofertilizers: Apply microbial inoculants or biofertilizers, such as rhizobia for legumes or plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), to introduce beneficial microbes directly into the soil.

9. Manage soil pH: Maintain soil pH within the optimal range for microbial growth, typically between 6.0 and 7.5. Adjust pH using organic amendments like lime or sulfur, if needed.

10. Provide a diverse plant community: Encourage a diverse mix of plants, including annuals, perennials, and plants with different root structures. A diverse plant community supports a diverse microbial community in the soil.

11. Practice conservation agriculture: Combine no-till or minimal tillage, continuous soil cover, and diverse crop rotations to create a favorable environment for microbial growth and diversity.

12. Minimize soil compaction: Avoid excessive soil compaction by reducing equipment traffic, using lighter machinery, or implementing controlled traffic farming. Compacted soils have reduced pore space, limiting microbial habitat and growth.

Consistently implementing these practices over time can significantly increase the microbial biomass in soil, leading to improved soil health, fertility, and overall ecosystem function. It's important to monitor soil health indicators regularly and adapt management practices based on site-specific conditions and goals.
