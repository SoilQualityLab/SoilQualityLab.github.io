**Sequester C as life**

Understand the reason for why Life is based upon the carbon cycle RATHER than just *pounding on about sand* involves [in part] intuitively understand how neurons have evolved over millions of years and now develop morphologically [and sustainably].

## Increasing soil organic matter

Increasing permanent levels of soil organic matter (SOM) and boosting long-term carbon storage in soil are crucial for improving soil health, fertility, and climate change mitigation. Here are some practices that can help achieve these goals:

1. Reduce tillage: Adopt no-till or minimal tillage practices to minimize soil disturbance. Tillage exposes SOM to air, leading to rapid decomposition and carbon loss. Reducing tillage helps maintain stable SOM levels and promotes carbon sequestration.

2. Incorporate diverse organic amendments: Apply a variety of organic materials, such as compost, biochar, humic substances, and crop residues, to the soil. These amendments provide a stable source of carbon that can persist in the soil for long periods.

3. Use cover crops: Plant a diverse mix of cover crops, including deep-rooted species and legumes. Cover crops add organic matter to the soil, improve soil structure, and protect the soil surface from erosion. The roots and residues of cover crops contribute to long-term SOM and carbon storage.

4. Implement agroforestry practices: Integrate trees and shrubs into agricultural systems through practices like alley cropping, silvopasture, and windbreaks. Trees and shrubs have deep, extensive root systems that add significant amounts of carbon to the soil and provide a stable, long-term carbon sink.

5. Manage grazing practices: Use rotational grazing or adaptive multi-paddock grazing systems to optimize forage growth and minimize soil disturbance. Well-managed grazing can stimulate root growth, increase SOM, and promote carbon sequestration in grassland soils.

6. Utilize perennial crops: Incorporate perennial crops, pastures, and grasslands into your farming system. Perennials have deep, extensive root systems that continually add organic matter to the soil and contribute to long-term carbon storage.

7. Optimize nutrient management: Implement precision nutrient management practices, such as soil testing, variable rate application, and split application of fertilizers. Adequate and balanced nutrient supply supports plant growth and root development, leading to increased SOM and carbon input.

8. Minimize bare soil: Keep the soil covered with living plants or residues as much as possible throughout the year. Bare soil is prone to erosion and rapid SOM decomposition. Use cover crops, mulches, or residue management to maintain soil cover.

9. Reduce soil compaction: Avoid excessive soil compaction by minimizing equipment traffic, using lighter machinery, or implementing controlled traffic farming. Compacted soils have reduced pore space, limiting root growth and SOM accumulation.

10. Implement wetland and peatland restoration: Restore degraded wetlands and peatlands, as these ecosystems are highly efficient at sequestering and storing carbon in their soils. Properly managed wetlands and peatlands can accumulate SOM and carbon over very long timescales.

11. Monitor, quantify and optimize carbon: Regularly monitor soil carbon levels using soil testing or remote sensing techniques. Quantifying carbon storage helps track progress and informs management decisions. Participate in carbon farming initiatives or carbon credit programs to incentivize and support carbon sequestration efforts.

Remember that building permanent SOM and increasing long-term soil carbon storage is a gradual process that requires consistent, long-term implementation of these practices. The specific combination of practices will depend on your local climate, soil type, and cropping system. Work with soil health professionals, extension services, or other experts to develop a tailored strategy for your unique circumstances.
