## Soil ecoystem modeling is fundmentally about infinitely recursive neural networks

The SQL motto of ***Sequester C as life*** is about the superiority of dynamic LIVING systems ... the neurology of life [on Earth, given the planet's temperature regime] is fundamentally more dynamic, more adaptable, more evolveable than silicon-based intelligence.

It's a matter of neurochemistry and why brains are NECESSARILY carbon-based, rather than silicon-based, ie it's chemically-impossible to produce dynamic, adaptable, evolveable life without the neuroplasticity of carbon-based life. Thus, brains could only have evolved as being carbon-based rather than silicon-based, despite silicon having some very similar chemical properties to carbon. 

Here's the key gist of the reasoning:

1. Temperature Regime:

- Earth's biosphere operates primarily between 0-40Â°C (with some extremophile exceptions)
- This temperature range is crucial for liquid water and liquid water is essential for life, particularly evolving, adaptable life as we know it 

2. Carbon's Properties at Earth Temperatures:

- Carbon forms stable but flexible covalent bonds at Earth's temperatures
- Carbon compounds can readily form and break bonds in this temperature range
- This allows for dynamic restructuring of neural connections (plasticity)
- Carbon-based molecules can maintain complex 3D structures while still being modifiable

3. Silicon's Limitations at Earth Temperatures:

- Silicon bonds are typically much stronger, more durable and less malleable than carbon bonds
- Silicon compounds tend to be more rigid and less reactive at Earth temperatures
- Silicon forms crystalline structures that are extremely stable but completely inflexible [on this planet]
- Silicon chemistry typically requires much higher temperatures [than those found on Earth] to be dynamic

4. Why This Matters for Brain Plasticity:

- Learning and memory require constant physical restructuring of neural connections
- Neurons need to form new connections and prune old ones
- This requires molecular flexibility at Earth's ambient temperatures
- Carbon's chemical properties allow this plasticity while maintaining structural stability

So while silicon can form complex compounds and could theoretically support some form of life, it wouldn't allow for the kind of dynamic neural plasticity we see in Earth's brains at Earth's temperatures. The plasticity that makes learning and adaptation possible requires the unique chemical properties of carbon operating in our planet's temperature range.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects?
