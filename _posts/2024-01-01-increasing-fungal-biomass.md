**Sequester C as life**

Understand the reason for why Life is based upon the carbon cycle RATHER than just *pounding on about sand* involves [in part] intuitively understand how neurons have evolved over millions of years and now develop morphologically [and sustainably].

## Increasing fungal biomass in soil

Increasing the fungal biomass in soil is crucial for maintaining soil health, as fungi play a vital role in nutrient cycling, soil structure, and plant growth. Here are some practices that can help greatly increase the fungal biomass in soil:

1. Reduce tillage: Minimizing soil disturbance through reduced tillage or no-till practices helps preserve the delicate fungal networks in the soil. Tilling disrupts these networks and can significantly reduce fungal biomass.

2. Maintain soil cover: Keep the soil covered with organic matter, such as mulch or cover crops. This provides a food source for fungi and helps maintain soil moisture, which is essential for fungal growth.

3. Incorporate diverse organic matter: Add a variety of organic materials to the soil, such as compost, leaf litter, wood chips, and straw. Different types of organic matter support different fungal communities, promoting diversity and biomass.

4. Encourage perennial plants and trees: Perennial plants and trees have extensive root systems that support long-lived fungal networks. Incorporating perennials into your landscape or agroforestry practices can help increase fungal biomass.

5. Use cover crops: Plant cover crops, particularly those with deep, fibrous roots like grasses and legumes. These crops contribute to soil organic matter and provide a host for beneficial fungi.

6. Avoid excessive fertilizer and pesticide use: High levels of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides can harm beneficial soil fungi. Opt for organic fertilizers and integrated pest management techniques to minimize negative impacts on soil biology.

7. Inoculate with beneficial fungi: Introduce beneficial fungi, such as mycorrhizal fungi, directly into the soil. These fungi form symbiotic relationships with plant roots, enhancing nutrient uptake and improving soil structure.

8. Manage soil pH: Most fungi thrive in slightly acidic soils (pH 5.5-6.5). If your soil pH is too high or low, consider amending it to create a more favorable environment for fungal growth.

9. Maintain soil moisture: Fungi require consistent moisture to grow and function properly. Implement irrigation practices that maintain optimal soil moisture levels without causing waterlogging.

10. Practice crop rotation: Rotate crops to prevent the buildup of soil-borne pathogens that can harm beneficial fungi. Include crops known to support mycorrhizal fungi, such as legumes and alliums, in your rotation.

Implementing these practices consistently over time can lead to a significant increase in fungal biomass, improving soil health and supporting the overall productivity and resilience of your growing system.
