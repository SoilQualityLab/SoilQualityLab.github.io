**Sequester C as life**

Understand the reason for why Life is based upon the carbon cycle RATHER than just *pounding on about sand* involves [in part] intuitively understand how neurons have evolved over millions of years and now develop morphologically [and sustainably].

## Increasing earthworm biomass in soil

Because earthworms are a key INDICATOR that everything is going well in the soil ... so **increasing the biomass of earthworms is depends on generally maintaining and improving all aspects of soil health. **

Of course, earthworms themselves are beneficial in their own right, earthworms and beneficial burrowing insects play a crucial role in soil health by improving soil structure, aeration, drainage, and nutrient cycling. Here are some practices that can help greatly increase the earthworm and beneficial burrowing insect biomass in soil:

1. Reduce/eliminate tillage: Minimize soil disturbance by adopting no-till or reduced tillage practices. Tillage can harm earthworms and disrupt the burrows of beneficial insects.

2. Increase organic matter: Add organic materials like compost, aged manure, leaf litter, and crop residues to the soil. Organic matter provides food and habitat for earthworms and insects, encouraging their populations to grow.

3. Maintain soil moisture: Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Earthworms and many beneficial insects thrive in moist soil conditions. Use mulch or cover crops to retain soil moisture.

4. Avoid synthetic chemicals: Reduce the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, as these can harm earthworms and beneficial insects. Opt for organic pest management techniques and fertilizers instead.

5. Plant diverse cover crops: Use a mix of cover crops, including deep-rooted species like alfalfa, clover, and chicory. These crops provide food and shelter for earthworms and insects while improving soil structure.

6. Implement crop rotation: Practice diverse crop rotation to prevent the buildup of soil-borne pests and diseases that can harm beneficial organisms. Include legumes and deep-rooted crops in the rotation to support earthworm and insect populations.

7. Incorporate perennials: Plant perennial crops, trees, or shrubs, as these provide a stable environment for earthworms and burrowing insects. Perennial roots help maintain soil structure and provide a consistent food source.

8. Use mulch: Apply organic mulches, such as straw, leaves, or wood chips, to the soil surface. Mulch helps retain moisture, regulate soil temperature, and provide a habitat for beneficial organisms.

9. Avoid soil compaction: Minimize soil compaction by reducing equipment traffic, using lighter machinery, or implementing controlled traffic farming. Compacted soils have fewer pore spaces, making it difficult for earthworms and insects to burrow and thrive.

10. Create insect habitats: Provide habitats for beneficial burrowing insects by leaving undisturbed areas of the field or garden, such as hedgerows or beetle banks. These areas offer shelter and overwintering sites for insects.

11. Introduce beneficial organisms: If populations are low, consider inoculating the soil with earthworms or beneficial insects. Ensure that the introduced species are native to your area and well-suited to your soil conditions.

12. Monitor and adapt: Regularly monitor earthworm and insect populations using methods like visual observation or soil sampling. Adapt your management practices based on the results to continually support and enhance these beneficial organisms.

By consistently implementing these practices, you can create a soil environment that encourages the growth and diversity of earthworms and beneficial burrowing insects. These organisms, in turn, will help improve soil health, structure, and fertility, leading to more productive and resilient agroecosystems.
