# **Sequester C as life** is not just a slogan; it defines SQL.ag.

SQL or Soil Quality Lab is, first of all, about ***living*** ecosystems ... living soil ecosystems which form the skin of our planet... we are primarily or especially interested in living soil ecoystems which are used in agriculture and which are absolutely necessary to sustain life, even human life.

We think that we are pretty good at what we do ... we are part of an intergeneration legacy of soil building that extends back for centuries ... it USED to be about things like machinery, plant genetics and fertility programs ... but, nowadays, we rely upon things like our competency in machine learning and artificial intelligence, high performance scientific computing and computational biophysics, neurophysical modeling of quantum information exchange in all living ecosystems to CONTINUE to be good stewards of soil.

**Sequester C as life** is not just a slogan ... we have been at this for hundreds of years ... and we are not going to stop because imbeciles cannot figure out something like the carbon cycle.
