# SQL.AG

Soil Quality Lab is, first of all, data science, computational biophysics and scientific modeling of all Life, especially living ecosystems we NEED, like soil.

Understanding soils is really about understanding LIVING ecosystems rather than simplistic recipes, like just N-P-K or micronutrients. 

Thinking about soil ecosystems and trying different things to improve the health of soil ecosystems and the plants that grow in those ecosystems is how people should think about ALL life, particularly living ecosystems in their intestinal track which dictate their immune response and whether they are able to fight off cancers, viruses, infections and other living agents that are not as clueless about Life as humans are.

Farmers and agronomists understand how and why LIVING soils are orders of magnitude more productive than DEAD dirt ... if you don't believe what someone is telling you about soil ecosytems or mycorrhizal networks, just ask the crops that grow in soils with high levels of decayed organic matter.  Look at the data, check out the GPS yield maps. You can readily find the area that was the pasture or animal yard fifty or even 100 years ago. It is the same if you want any horticultural project to really work, eg landscaping or a vegetable garden, you will first need to add large doses of soil organic matter [for a long time] to get the soil quality up to a productive level.

That's why ****LIFE means carbon**** especially the carbon that is embedded in organic matter such as fungi, some plant roots doing surface ops and maybe a bunch of worms/rodents/grazing herbivores doing digging/mixing ops.

## SQL.ag is a COMBINATION of tools for the virtual realm.

We use the virtual realm to speed up the rate at which we learn.  Of course, we want to spend a lot of time in Nature, a lot of time in the field ... but the virtual realm helps us get out to the field much faster ... that's why SQL.ag includes quasi-researchey data sciency tools and machine assistants ... starting with things like an open source RSS Newsreader ...  an ConnectedPapers-inspired Mycorrhiizal-like soil organic matter graph-in-nator for drawing the connections and differences between tens of thousands of peer-reviewed scientific papers ... a ToDo Checklist Bot for designing our experimental research, so that we spend more time in the field.
