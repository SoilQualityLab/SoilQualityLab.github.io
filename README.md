# **Sequester C as life** is not just a slogan ... but defines the SQL.ag business model.

SQL or Soil Quality Lab is, first of all, about ***living*** ecosystems ... we are primarily interested in living soil ecoystems used in agriculture which are necessary to sustain human life.

We think that we are pretty good at what we do ... we are part of an intergeneration legacy of soil building that extends back for centuries ... now we rely upon things like our competency in machine learning and artificial intelligence, high performance scientific computing and computational biophysics, neurophysical modeling of quantum information exchange in all living ecosystems to CONTINUE to be good stewards of soil.

**Sequester C as life** is not just a slogan ... we have been at this for hundreds of years ... and we are not going to stop because imbeciles cannot figure out something like the carbon cycle.
