Soil Quality Laboratory is first of all a knowledge-engineering laboratory ... it's about how people should think about soils, particularly soil ecosystems and the soil LIFE that transformed lifeless substrates into nutrient-dense living powerhouses.

LIVING soils are orders of magnitude more productive than DEAD dirt ... just ask the crops that grow in soils with high levels of decayed organic matter, ie look at the GPS yield maps and you can readily find the area that was the pasture or animal yard fifty or even 100 years ago. If you want anything horticultural to really work, eg landscaping or a vegetable garden, you will first need to add large doses of soil organic matter [for a long time] to get the soil quality up to a productive level.

That's why ****LIFE means carbon**** especially the carbon that is embedded in organic matter such as fungi, some plant roots doing surface ops and maybe a bunch of worms/rodents/grazing herbivores doing digging/mixing ops.
